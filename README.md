THIS DOES NOT WORK YET, IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

HP 3457A DMM LCD reverse engineered and now with ability to drive a 240x960 TFT LCD.

Visual Studio 2022 / VisualGDB and then convert to 240x960 TFT LCD.

The .HEX file is located in /VisualGDB/Debug

Uses VisualGDB available here:

NOTES:
1. Function prototypes in the headers are missing, I couldn't be bothered! VS2022 seems to compile just fine and produce working code without them.
