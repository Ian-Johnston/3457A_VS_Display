Advantest R6581 DMM VFD reverse engineered and now with ability to drive a 320x960 TFT LCD.

R6581 reverse engineering By Mickle T, he developed teh orignal OLED conversion, EEVBlog thread here:

My own input here is to import the original project to Visual Studio 2022 / VisualGDB and then convert
to 320x960 TFT LCD.

Uses VisualGDB available here:
