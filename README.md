HP 3457A DMM LCD reverse engineered and now with ability to drive a 240x960 TFT LCD.

Visual Studio 2022 / VisualGDB and then convert to 240x960 TFT LCD.

NOTES:
1. Function prototypes in the headers are missing, I couldn't be bothered! VS2022 seems to compile just fine and produce working code without them.
