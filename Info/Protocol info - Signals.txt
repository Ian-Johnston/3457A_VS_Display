SYNC Behavior
Purpose: Indicates whether the system is in command mode or data mode.
Behavior:
SYNC High (Command Mode):
  Commands are transmitted on the ISA line.
  INA is inactive or irrelevant.
SYNC Low (Data Mode):
  Data values (e.g., display digits) are transmitted on the INA line.
  ISA is inactive or irrelevant.




ISA Line Behavior
Purpose: Transmits commands during SYNC High.
Expected Observations:
When SYNC is high, the ISA line transmits a series of bits representing commands.
The transmitted bits should match known commands like:
  0x3F0 (Select Display)
  0x2F0 (Annunciators ON/OFF)
  0x028 (Write Register A)
  0x068 (Write Register B)
  0x0A8 (Write Register C)
Bits are transmitted LSB first.
Verify that the ISA bit transitions align with O2 clock edges during SYNC high.




INA Line Behavior
Purpose: Transmits data values (e.g., digits, punctuation) during SYNC Low.
Expected Observations:
When SYNC is low, the INA line transmits data in a similar format to the ISA line.
Bits represent:
  Display digits
  Punctuation marks
  Annunciators (in specific commands like 0x2F0).
Data should align with expected digit sequences (e.g., encoded HP charset values).
Bits are also transmitted LSB first.




Timing and Relationships
O2 Clock:
Both ISA and INA bits are sampled on the rising edge of the O2 clock.
Ensure that the O2 clock transitions occur in the middle of the bit window for proper sampling.
SYNC-to-ISA/INA Alignment:
  SYNC High:
    ISA begins transmitting bits immediately.
    There should be no delays or gaps in the ISA line.
  SYNC Low:
    INA begins transmitting bits immediately.
    Bits should align with the falling edge of SYNC and rising edge of O2 clock.



Known Command and Data Structures
Command Frame (SYNC High, ISA Active):
  10 bits transmitted per command (e.g., 0x3F0 = 1111110000).
  Bits should be sent in reverse order (LSB first).
Data Frame (SYNC Low, INA Active):
  18 bytes transmitted (6 bytes each for Register A, B, and C).
  Each byte represents digit data, punctuation, or annunciators.



Key Observations for Debugging:
ISA and INA patterns: Look for valid commands (0x3F0, etc.) and numerical data.
SYNC and O2 alignment: Ensure data is captured on correct clock edges.
Bit-reversed decoding: Validate that commands and data are properly reversed and interpreted.
Frame completeness: Confirm all parts of a frame (commands and data) are present and correctly decoded.
